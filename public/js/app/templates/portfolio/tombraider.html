<p>The Tomb Raider Scavenger Hunt was a web application that was only accessible by customers who preordered Square Enixâ€™s 2013 Tomb Raider video game. Each week users were given trivia and photo challenges. When users completed these challenges they unlocked free ingame DLC. These challenges created a variety of UGC that was used throughout the social media campaign.</p>
